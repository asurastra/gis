Practical No. 2(C)

A mosaic is a combination of multiple raster images into one.


In GIS, a single raster dataset can be created from multiple raster datasets by mosaicing them together.


---------------------------------------------


Steps:
1. Go to Raster → Add Layer → Add Raster Layer.


2. Click on the three dots and select all master images of India. Click OK and then click Add.


3. Go to Raster → Miscellaneous → Merge.


4. An emerge dialogue window will open. Click on the three dots, select input layers, and then click on Run.


5. A new layer will be created in the layers tab. Deselect the layers of master images.


6. Now, we need to add the outline of the India map.


7. For that, Go to Layers → Add Layer → Select adm0 file.


8. From the Layer tab → Utilize the transparency for the map.


9. Go to Raster Menu → Click on Extraction → Clip Raster by Mask Layer.


A new clipped raster will be created.


The mosaiced file will be clipped.


Select the adm0 file as the input layer.


10. Save the output layer by clicking on the three dots and selecting Save to file.


11. Easily toggle one raster over another
