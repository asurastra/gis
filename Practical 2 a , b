Practical 2(A) and (B)

Open QGIS application.
Click on new project
-------------------------------
Step 1: Go to Layer ---> Add Layer ---> Add Raster Layer


Step 2: Add "90-60" and "00-60" files (first on-screen .asc files only).
Ensure that CRS options 84 has been selected.


Step 3: Click on "90-60" files ---> Go to Properties ---> Symbolology ---> Select single band grey as single band pseudo colour ---> Select bandwidth 0-240 ---> select colour ramp "Yellow-Orange-Red"


Step 4: repeat the same steps as for "00-60"
In both the file's properties the interpolation will be of linear type.


(*Please Note: "90-60" files stands for year 1990 and "00-60" files for year 2000)


Now styling for both the files or layers is being provided.
The calculation part is to be performed


---------------------------------------------


For calculation part, Go to Raster option in the Menu


Step 5: Go to Raster ---> Raster Calculator. New tab will be opened.


Step 6: Subtract "00-60" file with "90-60" file (i.e year 2000 - year 1990 file).


Step 7: Raster Calculation ---> Expression / Equation â€”
"glds00ag60@1 - glds90ag60@1"


Step 8: Go and click on the 3 dots which is on the right hand side (RHS) of the tab.
Give the name to the output file and then Click OK.


A new layer will be created


Step 9: Click on the new layer created ---> click on Symbolology ---> select single band psudo colour ---> now select interpolation is Discrete ---> select colour ramp "Orange-Yellow-Red" ---> Bandwidth range from -2000 to 6000


Step 10: Now change the values and give different colours and labels.


There are 4 different values:


Values <=  |  Colours |  Label
-20000    |    Black   |  No data
-10             |   Red.     |  Negative
10              |   Yellow  |   Neutral 
6000        |    Blue     |  Positive
